###### 1. NETWORK CONFIGURATION


> 
> 		**Static IP**
> 
> 			- ip addr 				         to check the ip
> 			- ip addr show dev eth0             Display eth0 address and details
> 			- ip a                                           Display all network interfaces and IP address
> 			- sudo lshw -class network		 dentify all network interfaces available to your system
> 			- curl https://ipinfo.io/ip             get public ip
> 
> 
> 		**CHANGE IP ADDRESSES**
> 
> 			- To assign an IP of "192.168.2.100" to your ethernet connection ("eth0"), for example, youd enter sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.0.100 netmask 255.255.255.0 here.
> 			- $ ifconfig <interface_name> <ip_address> netmask <netmask_address>
> 
> 				example: $ ifconfig enp0s3 192.168.178.32/24
> 						 $ ifconfig enp0s3 192.168.178.32 netmask 255.255.255.0
> 






> 
> 	**Dynamic IP**
> 
> >	To configure a dynamic IP in Ubuntu or another Linux distribution, the most common thing is to leave the default network interface so that it obtains the configuration via DHCP. You simply have to make sure that in the /etc/network/interfaces file the interface is defined as:
> 
> 		1. auto eth0
> 	        2. iface eth0 inet dhcp
> 		3. sudo service networking restart
> 
> 		This will cause eth0 to obtain an IP, netmask, gateway and DNS automatically from the network's DHCP server.







> 
> 	 **Static IP**
> 	 
> 	     sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
> 	     auto eth0
		iface eth0 inet static
		address 192.168.1.10
		netmask 255.255.255.0
		gateway 192.168.1.1
		sudo service networking restart










###### 2. HOSTNAME CONFIGURATION


> 
> 	- hostname			                    to retrieve the hostname of the machine
>         - hostname -I                                         Display all local IP addresses of the host.
>         - hostnamectl					    to retrieve most information about the host
>        - hostnamectl set-hostname parrot        to change the hostname
> 





###### 3. DHCP

> 
> 		- ip route		    way to query the DHCP server from a Linux machine
> 






###### 4. DNS

> 
> 	  DNS servers maintain (and possibly share) a collection of database files, also known as zone files—typically simple plain-text ASCII files, storing the name and IP address mapping.
> 	  In Linux, one such DNS resolver file is;
> 
> 
> 		- nano /etc/resolv.conf 			                             to retrieve the DNS
> 		- cat /etc/resolv.conf | grep nameserver                        Get Nameservers
> 
> 
> 		- sudo apt-get install dnsutils			                      to nslookup
> 		- nslookup local.machine			                               For example, to query the name-server information for a computer named neptune.local in our local network,
> 
> 		-dig local.machine					                        to get information about a host
> 








###### 5. AUTHENTICATION SERVER

> 
> 
> 	  Standalone Linux systems typically use the default authentication mechanism, where user credentials are stored in the local filesystem (such as /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow).
> 
> 	  Examples of standard secure authentication platforms (available for Linux); output
> 
> 
> 	  - Kerberos (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerberos_(protocol))
> 	  - LDAP (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol)
> 	  - Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RADIUS)
> 	  - Diameter (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter_(protocol))
> 	  - Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System (TACACS+) (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8907/)
> 
> 







###### 6. FILE SHARING

>
> 	**SMB**
> 		- The Server Message Block (SMB) protocol provides network discovery and file- and printer-sharing services.
> 		- The Common Internet File System (CIFS) protocol is a particular implementation of the SMB protocol
> 
> 
> 	**SAMBA**
> 		- Samba is another implementation of the SMB protocol. Samba provides file- and print-sharing services for Windows clients on a variety of server platforms


>   **NFS**
> 		- The Network File System (NFS) protocol was developed by Sun Microsystems nd essentially operates on the same premise as SMB—accessing files over a network as  if they were local.
> 		- NFS is not compatible with CIFS or SMB, meaning that NFS clients cannot communicate directly to SMB servers, or viceversa.
> 
> 

> 
> 
> 	**SCP COMMAND**
> 
> 
> 
> 		- scp [OPTION] [user@]SRC_HOST:]file1 [user@]DEST_HOST:]file2
> 
> 
> 			Copy a File from Local to Remote Server
> 
> 			 - scp Desktop/sample_example.txt root@136.183.142.28:/home/remote_dir
> 
> 
> 			 Copy a File from a Remote Server to the Local Host
> 
> 			 - ==scp 147.182.143.27:/home/remote_dir/sample_example.txt home/Desktop==
> 
> 
> 			 Copy a File from One Remote Server to Another
> 
> 			 - scp root@147.182.143.27:/home/remote_dir/sample_example.txt sofija@146.153.129.25:home/Desktop
> 
> 
> 			 Copy Multiple Files with SCP
> 
> 			 - scp example/sample1.txt example/sample2.txt root@147.182.143.27:/home/remote_dir
> 
> 
> 			 Copy a File with SCP Using a Specific Port
> 
> 			 - scp -P 2222  Desktop/sample_example.txt root@147.182.143.27:/home/remote_dir
> 






###### 7. SSH

> 
> 	    - ssh user@host                              Connect to host as user
> 	    - ssh -p port user@host                  Connect to host using port






###### 8. IPTABLES

> 
> 	iptables operates with rules associated with chains. A rule defines the criteria for matching the packets traversing a specific chain. iptables uses tables to organize rules based on criteria or decision type.
> 
>
> 		- sudo apt-get install iptables									install iptables

> 
> 		**Types of Chains**
> 
> 			iptables uses three different chains: input, forward, and output.
> 
> 			1. Input – This chain is used to control the behavior for incoming connections. For example, if a user attempts to SSH into your PC/server, iptables will attempt to match the IP address and port to a rule in the input chain.
> 
> 			2. Forward – This chain is used for incoming connections that aren’t actually being delivered locally. Think of a router – data is always being sent to it but rarely actually destined for the router itself; the data is just forwarded to its target. Unless you’re doing some kind of routing, NATing, or something else on your system  that requires forwarding, you won’t even use this chain.
> 
> 
> 			3. Output – This chain is used for outgoing connections. For example, if you try to ping howtogeek.com, iptables will check its output chain to see what the rules are regarding ping and  howtogeek.com before making a decision to allow or deny the connection attempt.

> 			  - iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport xxx -j ACCEPT						                          top allow incoming connections

> 	    	nftables is a successor of iptables. nftables is a firewall management framework that supports packet filtering, Network Address Translation NAT), and various packet  shaping operations
