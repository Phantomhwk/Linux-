###### 6. SNAP & FLATPACK


> 
>             Snaps and ﬂatpaks are relatively new package types that are used in various Linux distributions. In this section, we will show you how to manage these
>             types of packages. For snaps we will use Ubuntu as our test distribution, and for ﬂatpaks we will use CentOS, even though, with a little bit of work, both
>             package types can work on either distribution. Flatpak is a framework for distributing desktop applications across various Linux distributions.
>             It has been created by developers who have a long history of working on the Linux desktop, and is run as an independent open source project.
>             The snap ﬁle is actually a SquashFS ﬁle. This means that it has its own ﬁlesystem encapsulated in an immutable container. It has a very restrictive
>             environment, with speciﬁc rules for isolation and conﬁnement. Every snap ﬁle has a meta-information directory that stores ﬁles that control its behavior
> 
> 
>             - snap find package                                               to search a package
>             - snap install package                                            to install a package
>             - snap info package                                               to show info about a package
>             - snap list
>             - snap refresh package                                           to update
>             - snap revert package                                            to back previously version
>             - snap remove package

>             https://snapcraft.io/store
> 
> 
> 
>             The same as snaps, ﬂatpaks are isolated applications that run inside sandboxes. Each ﬂatpak contains the needed runtimes and libraries for the application.
>             Flatpaks oﬀer full support for graphical user interface management tools,together with a full set of commands that can be used from the Command
>             Line Interface (CLI). The main command is called ﬂatpak, which has several other built-in commands to use for package management.
>             Flatpak is based on a technology called OSTree. The technology was started by developers from GNOME and Red Hat, and it is now heavily used in Fedora
>             Silverblue in the form of rpm-ostree
> 
> 
>             - flatpak search package
>             - flatpak install package
>             - flatpak update

###### 7. PIP


> 
>             - Pip is a Python package installer recommended for installing Python packages that are not available in the Debian archive. It can work with version control
>             - repositories (currently only Git, Mercurial, and Bazaar repositories), logs output extensively, and prevents partial installs by downloading all 
>             - requirements before starting installation.

###### 8. git

> 
> 
>           - Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals.
>           - Nevertheless, before we download the project and its scripts and lists, we should create a particular folder.
>           - mkdir ~/nishang/ && git clone https://github.com/samratashok/nishang.git ~/nishang

###### 9. GENERAL INFORMATION

> 
>             Managing software packages Each distribution has its own package managers. There are two types of package managers for each distribution, one for low-level
>             and one for high-level package management. For an RPM-based distribution such as CentOS or Fedora, the low-level tool is the rpm command, and the high-level 
>             tools are the yum and dnf commands. For openSUSE, another major RPM-based distribution, the low-level tool is the same rpm command, and for high-level tools, 
>             there is the zypper command.  For DEB-based distributions, the low-level command is dpkg and the high-level command is apt (or the now deprecated apt-get).
> 
>             What is the diﬀerence between low-level and high-level package managers in Linux? The low-level package managers are responsible for the backend of any
>             package manipulation, and are capable of unpacking packages, running scripts, and installing apps. The high-end managers are responsible for dependency
>             resolution, installing and downloading packages (and groups of packages), and metadata searching.

>             **TTHE REPOSITORY**
> 
>             The Ubuntu oﬀicial repositories consist of about 60,000 packages. Those take the form of binary .deb packages or as snap packages. The conﬁguration of the
>             system repositories is stored in one ﬁle, the /etc/apt/sources.list ﬁle. Ubuntu has four main repositories, and you will see them detailed inside the
>             sources.list ﬁle. Those repositories are as follows:
> 
>             1. Main – Contains free and open source software supported by Canonical
>             2. Universe – Contains free and open source software supported by the community
>             3. Restricted – Contains proprietary software
>             4. Multiverse – Contains software restricted by copyright
