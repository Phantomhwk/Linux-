###### 1. LINUX COMPONENTS

> 
>        - Bootloader                  A piece of code that runs to guide the booting process to start the operating system. Parrot Linux uses the GRUB Bootloader.
>        - OS kernel                    The kernel is the main component of an operating system. It manages the resources for I/O devices the system at the hardware level.
>        - Daemons                     Background services are called "daemons" in Linux. Their purpose is to ensure that key functions such as scheduling, printing,                  
>        - OS shell                       The operating system shell or the command language interpreter (also known as the command line) is the interface between the OS and the user. 
>        - Graphical Server          This provides a graphical sub-system (server) called "X" or "X-server" that allows graphical programs to run locally or remotely on the X-windowing system.
>        - Windows Manager      Also known as a graphical user interface (GUI). There are many options, including GNOME, KDE, MATE, Unity, and Cinnamon.
>        - Utilities                        Applications or utilities are programs that perform particular functions for the user or another program.











###### 2 LINUX ARCHITECTURE


> 
> 	The Linux operating system can be broken down into layers:
> 	
> 	- Hardware          Peripheral devices such as the systems RAM, hard drive, CPU, and others.
> 	- Kernel               The core of the Linux operating system whose function is to virtualize and control common computer hardware resources like CPU, allocated memory, accessed data, and others. The  
> 	                            kernel gives each process its own virtual resources and prevents/mitigates conflicts between different processes.
> 	 - Shell                 A command-line interface (CLI), also known as a shell that a user can enter commands into to execute the kernels functions.
> 	 - System Utility   Makes available to the user all of the operating systems functionality.

###### 3. LINUX FILES SYSTEMS HIERARCHY

> 
> 
>    The Linux operating system is structured in a tree-like hierarchy and is documented in the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS). Linux is structured with the following standard top-level directories:
>
>
>         /                The top-level directory is the root filesystem and contains all of the files required to boot the operating system before other filesystems are mounted as  well as the files required to boot the  other filesystems. After boot,  all of  the other filesystems are mounted at standard mount points as subdirectories  of the root.
>         /bin            Contains essential command binaries.
>         /boot         Consists of the static bootloader, kernel executable, and files required to boot the Linux OS.
>         /dev           Contains device files to facilitate access to every hardware device attached to the system.
>         /etc            Local system configuration files. Configuration files for installed applications may be saved here as well.
>         /home        Each user on the system has a subdirectory here for storage.
>         /lib             Shared library files that are required for system boot.
>         /media        External removable media devices such as USB drives are mounted here.
>         /mnt           Temporary mount point for regular filesystems.
>         /opt            Optional files such as third-party tools can be saved here.
>         /root           The home directory for the root user.
>         /sbin           This directory contains executables used for system administration (binary system files).
>         /tmp           The operating system and many programs use this directory to store temporary files. 
>         /usr            Contains executables, libraries, man files, etc.
>         /var            This directory contains variable data files such as log files, email in-boxes, web application related files, cron files, and more.
