 ###### 1. LINUX LAYERS

> 
>         A Linux system is generally organized on three major levels:
> 
>         1. Hardware level                 Ram, CPU,network interface, disks, controllers
>         2. kernel level                      write in C.
>         3. User space level






###### 2. FILES TYPES

> 
> 
>         - Ext2: The very first file system for Linux was the MINIX file system. It was later replaced by the first file system ever written specifically for Linux, which was Ext. Ext2 was Ext’s successor. 
>         - Ext3: This was the successor to Ext2, and can be thought of as Ext2 with journaling, which protects your file system from data corruption caused by crashes and sudden power loss. 32-bit addressing
>         - Ext4: Ext4 is the standard file system for may Linux distributions. It is a solid, tried, and trusted file system. It has features that reduce  file fragmentation and can be used with larger drives, partitions, and files than Ext3. 48-bit addressing
>         - BFS: This is the Boot File System, which is designed for one job and one only: to handle the files in the boot partition. It’s rare that you’d be creating a boot file system by hand. 
>         - FAT: The File Allocation Table file system was designed for floppy disks by a consortium of computer-industry heavyweights. It was introduced in 1977. The only reason you’d use this non-journaling  file system is for compatibility with non-Linux operating systems.
>         - NTFS: The New Technology File System is a Microsoft journaling file system introduced with Windows NT. It was the successor to FAT. The only reason you’d use this file system is for compatibility  with non-Linux operating systems.
>         - MINIX: Originally created by Andrew S. Tanenbaum as an educational aid, MINIX is a “mini-Unix” operating system. Nowadays, it is aimed at providing a self-healing and fault-tolerant operating   system. The MINIX file system was designed as a simplified version of the Unix File System. Perhaps if  you are cross-developing on a Linux computer and targetting a MINIX platform you may use this file system. Or perhaps you need compatibility with a MINIX computer for other reasons. Use cases for    this file system on a Linux computer are not leaping out at me, but it’s available.
>         - VFAT: Virtual File Allocation Table, was introduced with Windows 95, and removed the eight-character limit for filenames. File names of up to 255 characters became possible. The only reason you’d use this file system is for compatibility with non-Linux operating systems.
>         - CRAMFS: The Compressed ROM File System is a read-only file system designed for embedded systems and specialist read-only uses, such as in the boot processes of Linux computers. It is comm to  have a small, transient, file system loaded first so that

**3. COMMON DISK CONCEPTS**

> 
>     **Interfaces**
> 
>             - Integrated Drive Electronics (IDE) – This is an old standard used on consumer hardware with small transfer rates; now deprecated.
>             - Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA) – Replaced IDEs; with transfer rates of up to 16 Gb/s.
>             - Small Computer Systems Interface (SCSI) – Used mostly in enterprise servers with RAID configurations with sophisticated hardware components.
>             - Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) – This is a point-to-point serial protocol interface with transfer rates similar to SATA, mostly used in enterprise environments fortheir reliability.
>             - Universal Serial Bus (USB) – Used for external hard drives and memory drives.





###### 4. PARTITION DISK CONCEPTS


>         - Master Boot Record (MBR)
>         - GUID Partition Table (GPT)






###### 5. PARTITION TABLE
> 
>
>         - The partition table of a disk is stored inside the disk MBR. The MBR is the first 512 bytes of a drive. Out of these, the partition table is 64 bytes and is stored after the first 446 bytes of records. At the end of the MBR, there are 2 bytes known as the end of sector marker. The first 446 bytes are reserved for code that usually belongs to a bootloader program. In the case of Linux, the bootloader is called GRUB.
> 
> 
>         - The first hard drive is always /dev/sda (for an SCSI or SATA device).
>         - The second hard drive is /dev/sdb,
>         - The third is /dev/sdc, and so on.
>         - The first partition of the first disk is /dev/sda1.
>         - The first partition of the second disk is /dev/sdb1.
>         - The second partition of the second disk is /dev/sdb2, and so on.
> 
> 
> 
>         - lsblk                                          to check the disks and partitions
>         - blkid
> 
>         - badblocks -s /dev/sda             Test for unreadable blocks on disk sda
>         - hdparm -tT /dev/sda               Perform a read speed test on disk sda
>         - hdparm -i /dev/sda                  Show info about disk sda.

###### 6. PARTITION TABLE EDITORS

> 
> 
>         - In Linux, there are several tools to use when managing partition tables.
> 
>             1. fdisk                     A command-line partition editor, perhaps the most widely used one
>             2. sfdisk                    A non-interactive partition editor, used mostly in scripting
>             3. parted                 The GNU (the recursive acronym for GNU is Not Unix) partition manipulation software
>             4. Gparted              The graphical interface for parted
> 
> 
> 
>             - fdisk -l                        Display disks partitions sizes and types.
>             - fdisk -m                      help to modify the partitions
>             - fdisk -d                      delete the partition
>             - cfdisk                         like fdisk but graphic

###### 7. FORMATTING AND CHECKING PARTITION TABLE

> 
> 
>              - mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda                                                  to format a partition on ext4
>              - mkfs -t ext4 -v -c -L newpartition /dev/sdb1           -t (type extension) -v verbose - c bad sector sccaning - L name for partition
> 
> 
>             - **fsck**                   is used to check and optionally repair one or more Linux file systems.
> 
>                 -A – Used for checking all filesystems. The list is taken from /etc/fstab.
>                 -C – Show progress bar.
>                 -l – Locks the device to guarantee no other program will try to use the partition during the check.
>                 -M – Do not check mounted filesystems.
>                 -N – Only show what would be done – no actual changes are made.
>                 -P – If you want to check filesystems in parallel, including root.
>                 -R – Do not check root filesystem. This is useful only with ‘-A‘.
>                 -r – Provide statistics for each device that is being checked.
>                 -T – Does not show the title.
>                 -t – Exclusively specify the filesystem types to be checked. Types can be comma separated list.
>                 -V – Provide description what is being done.
> 
> 
>                      **man fsck**
> 
>                     0      No errors
>                     1      Filesystem errors corrected
>                     2      System should be rebooted
>                     4      Filesystem errors left uncorrected
>                     8      Operational error

###### 8. MOUNTING AND UNMOUNTING PARTITIONS

>
> 
>          - mount                             main command to mount a partition
>          - umount                           main command to umount a partition
> 
> 
>          - To mount it, we need to make a new directory. For simplicity, we will show all the steps required for you to mount and use the partition:
> 
>          1. sudo fdisk /dev/sda                         to create a new partition table
>          2. g                                                      Select the g option from the fdisk menu to create a new, empty GPT partition table.
>          3. w                                                      to Write the changes to disk
>          5. sudo mkdir /mnt/hdd                      Create a new directory to mount the partition
>          6. sudo mount /dev/sda /mnt/hdd      mount the partition
> 
> 
>          1. sudo umount /dev/sda               umount a partition.
> 
>          - sudo lsof | grep /dev/sda	      close all applications running on the partition to be able to mount or unmount it
> 
> 
>          - Mounting a filesystem only makes them available until the system is shut down or rebooted. If you want the changes to be persistent, you will have to edit the
> 		  /etc/fstab file accordingly. First, open the file with your favorite text editor:
> 
> 
>           1. sudo nano /etc/fstab      /Add a new line similar to the one that follows: /dev/sda /mnt/sdb ext4 defaults 0 0
> 
> 
> 		The /etc/fstab file is a configuration file for the filesystem table. It consists of a set of rules needed to control how the filesystems are used. This simplifies the need to manually mount and unmount each disk when used, by drastically reducing possible errors. The table has a six-column structure, with each column designated with a specific parameter. There is only one correct order for the parameters to work as follows:
> 
> 		- Device name – Either by using UUID or the mounted device name.
> 		- Mount point – The directory where the device is, or will be, mounted.
> 		- Filesystem type – The filesystem type used.
> 		- Options – The options shown, with multiple ones separated by commas.
> 		- Backup operation – This is the first digit from the last two digits in the file; 0 = no backup, 1 = dump utility backup.
> 		- Filesystem check order – This is the last digit inside the file; 0 = no fsck filesystem check, with 14for the root filesystem, and 2 for other partitions.

###### 10. SWAP

> 
> 
> 		Linux uses a robust swap implementation. The virtual memory uses hard drive space when physical memory is no longer available, through swap. This additional space is  made available either for the programs that do not use all the memory they are given, or when memory pressure is high.
> 
> 
> 		- cat /proc/swaps		To check the actual swap used on the system
> 		- free			                You can also check the memory usage with the free command
> 
> 		- mkswap /dev/sda1	       If swap is not set up on your system, you can format a partition as swap and activate it. The commands to do that areas follows:
