###### 1. LINUX PROCESSES

> 
> 
>          - Foreground (interactive)
>                              Are started and controlled through a Terminal session. Foreground processes are usually initiated by a user via an interactive command-line interface. A foreground process may output results to the console (stdout or stderr) or accept user input.
>          - Background (non-interactive or automated)
>                              run independently of a Terminal session, without expecting any user interaction. A user may invoke multiple background processes within the same Terminal session without waiting on any of them to complete or exit.
> 
> 
>
>         - jobs           check foreground process
>         - fg 1           we want to get the background process into the foreground and interact with it again, we can use the fg ID command.

###### 2. INTRODUCING TO DAEMONS

> 
>         Daemons are a particular type of background process that are usually started upon system boot and run indeﬁnitely or until terminated (for example, during system shutdown). A daemon doesnt have a user-controlled Terminal, even though it is associated with a system account (root or other) and runs with the related privileges.
> 
> 
> 
>          - systemd: The parent of all processes (formerly known as init)
>          - crond: Job scheduler – runs tasks in the background
>          - ftpd: FTP server – handles client FTP requests
>          - httpd: Web server (Apache) – handles client HTTP requests
>          - sshd: Secure shell server – handles SSH client requests
> 
> 
>            Typically, system daemons in Linux are named with a d at the end, denoting a daemon process. Daemons are controlled by shell scripts usually stored in the /etc/init.d/          or /lib/systemd/

###### 3. THE INIT PROCESS

> 
>         - init (or systemd, and others) is essentially a system daemon, and its among the ﬁrst processes to start when Linux boots up. The related daemon process continues to run in the background until the system is shut down. init is the root (parent) process of all other processes in Linux in the overall process Hierarchy tree. In other words, init is a direct or indirect ancestor of all the processes in the system.
> 






###### 5. SYSTEMD


> 
>         A systemd is a System Management Daemon named with UNIX convention to add ‘d‘ at the end of daemon. So, that they can be easily recognized. Initially it was released under GNU General Public License, but now the releases are made under GNU Lesser General Public License. Similar to init, systemd is the parent of all other processes directly or indirectly and is the first process that starts at boot hence typically assigned a “pid=1“.systemd is a suite of basic building blocks for a Linux system. It provides a system and service manager that runs as PID 1 and starts the rest of the system. systemd provides aggressive parallelization capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services,  offers on-demand starting of daemons, keeps track of processes using Linux control groups, maintains mount and automount points, and implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic. systemd supports SysV and LSB init scripts and works as a replacement for sysvinit.

>         Epoch – A init replacement daemon built around simplicity and service management, designed to start process single-threaded.
>         Mudar – A init replacement daemon written in Python, implemented on Pardus GNU/Linux and designed to start process asynchronously.
>         systemd – A init replacement daemon designed to start process in parallel, implemented in a number of standard distribution – Fedora, OpenSuSE, Arch, RHEL, CentOS, etc.

###### 6.  PARENT AND CHILD PROCESS

>         - A parent process creates other subordinate processes, also known as child processes. Child processes belong to the parent process that spawned them and usually terminate when the parent process exits (stops execution).
> 







###### 7. BATCH PROCESSES


> 
>         - A batch process is typically a script or a command thats been scheduled to run at a speciﬁc date and time, possibly in a periodical fashion.




###### 8.  THE ANATOMY OF A PROCESS

> 
> 
>         - pid               Each. process in Linux has a PID automatically assigned by the kernel when the process is created. The PID is a positive integer and is always guaranteed to be unique.
>         - tty                is short for teletype, more popularly known as a controlling Terminal or device for interacting with a system. In the context of a Linux process, the TTY attribute denotes the type of     
>                               Terminal the process interacts with.
>         - time             represents the cumulative CPU utilization (or time) spent by the process (in [DD-]hh:mm:ss format)
> >      - cmd             stands for command and indicates the name or full path of the command (including the arguments) that created the process.
> 
> 
> 
> 
>         **ps command**
> 
>             - ps                                    Display your currently running processes
>             - ps -ef                               Display ll the currently running processes on the system.
>             - ps -ef | head                    Display top process
>             - ps -ef | grep ssh               Display process information for process name
>             - ps -a                                All process associate to TTY
>             - ps -x                                 Process no associate with TTY
>             - ps -f                                 All process in large format
>             - ps -u                                Process sort by users
>             - pstree                              Display the whole process tree, and it shows the init process at its root

>             - top
>             - top -p +pid                      to check an speciﬁc process

###### 9. KILL AND KILL COMMAND

> 
> 
>         The kill command sends a signal to a process, attempting to stop its execution. When no signal is speciﬁed, SIGTERM (15) is sent
> 
>         We use the kill command to terminate processes. The commands syntax is as follows:
> 
>         - kill [OPTIONS] [ -s SIGNAL | -SIGNAL ] PID [...]


>         - kill -L           Provide a full list of signals that can be used in Linux
> 
>             - 15 = sigterm                          end processes
>             - 9 = sigkill                               kill the processes
>             - 17, 19, 23 =sigtop                 pause the processes
>             - 3 = sigquit                             keyboard output
>             - 1 = sigmup                            read configuration
>             - kill pid                                    Kill process with process ID of pid
>             - killall processname                 Kill all processes named processname
> 
> 
>                  The most commonly used signals are:
> 
>                     1 (HUP) - Reload a process.
>                     9 (KILL) - Kill a process.
>                     15 (TERM) - Gracefully stop a process.
>

>             ==- kill -9 PID         to kill a process==

###### 10. THE PGGREP AND PKILL COMMANDS

> 
>         pgrep and pkill are pattern-based lookup commands for exploring and terminating running processes. They have the following syntax:
> 
>         pgrep [OPTIONS] PATTERN
>         Pkill [OPTIONS] PATTERN
> 
>         pgrep iterates through the current processes and lists the process IDs matching the selection pattern or criteria. Similarly, pkill terminates the
>         processes matching the selection criteria.
> 
> 
>             - pgrep ssh                       To locate all ssh processes running
>             - pgrep ssh -l                    option tells pgrep to show the process name along with its ID
> 
>

###### 11. WORKING WITH SysV DAEMONS

> 
>         In SysV environments, we typically use the service command to explore and control daemons.
>         We can control a daemon (for example, httpd) invoking start, stop, and restart with the service command. For example, the following command will
>         stop the httpd service.
> 
> 
>             - chkconfig httpd off                         Centos
>             - chkconfig --list                                Display all daemon running
> 




###### 12. EXECUTE MULTIPLES COMMANDS

> 
>     There are three possibilities to run several commands, one after the other. These are separated by:
> 
>     - Semicolon (;)
>     - Double ampersand characters (&&)
>     - Pipes (|)
> 





###### 13. CRONTAB

> 
>             The crontab is a list of commands that you want to run on a regular schedule, and also the name of the command used to manage that list. 
>             Crontab stands for “cron table, ” because it uses the job scheduler cron to execute tasks.
> 
> 
>             Crontab Format: MIN HOUR DOM MON DOW CMD
